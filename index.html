            <h2>What is Zoology?</h2>
            <div class="p-container">
                <p>Zoology is the branch of biology that focuses on animals, their bodies, their behavior, and the ways
                    they interact with the world around them. It looks at animals at every scale, from microscopic
                    organisms drifting in water to massive mammals roaming land and sea. At its core, zoology asks
                    simple but powerful questions: how animals are built, how they survive, how they reproduce, and how
                    they fit into the larger web of life.
                </p>

                <p>A major part of zoology is understanding animal structure and function. This includes anatomy, which
                    studies the physical parts of animals, and physiology, which explores how those parts work together
                    to keep an animal alive. Zoologists might study how a bird’s lungs are adapted for flight, how a
                    cheetah’s muscles generate explosive speed, or how a fish’s gills extract oxygen from water. These
                    details reveal how evolution has shaped animals to thrive in specific environments.</p>

                <p>Zoology also explores animal behavior and ecology. Behavior focuses on how animals act, communicate,
                    hunt, mate, and raise their young, while ecology examines how animals interact with their
                    environment and with other species. Through this, zoologists learn how ecosystems stay balanced and
                    what happens when that balance is disturbed. Observing a lion’s hunting strategy or the social
                    structure of ants can teach us a lot about survival, cooperation, and adaptation.</p>

                <p>Another key area of zoology is evolution and classification. Zoologists classify animals into groups
                    based on shared characteristics and evolutionary history, helping us understand how different
                    species are related. By studying fossils, genetics, and living species, zoology explains how animals
                    have changed over millions of years and how new species arise. This evolutionary perspective ties
                    all animal life together into one long, unfolding story.</p>

                <p>Finally, zoology has strong real-world importance. It plays a major role in wildlife conservation,
                    environmental protection, veterinary science, and even medicine. Zoologists help protect endangered
                    species, manage wildlife populations, and study diseases that pass between animals and humans. In a
                    world where habitats are constantly changing, zoology acts like a living archive and a warning
                    system, helping us understand animals so we can protect both them and the ecosystems we share.</p>
